# RuntimeClient

Welcome! Here is my implementation of a runtime client which edits bytecode automaticly.

### Features / Pros

- It's able to override and "patch (still being worked on)" into methods
- Your able to write your client / new clazzes with the custom annotations

### Cons / Features yet to be implemented

- It's only able to override and "patch (still being worked on)" methods, it cannot change field varibles for e.g: "int
  example;" -> "String example;"
- Doesn't patch correctly
- Not very well documented
